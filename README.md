# Training to build a deployment pipeline

I did this project to train Docker : what is a container, how to write a Dockerfile, a compose file, how to use multi-stage build for performance etc

## Technical tools

- Vite.js : A fast server to build a basic app
- Nginx : A very lightweight web host
- Docker : The standard to containerize apps
